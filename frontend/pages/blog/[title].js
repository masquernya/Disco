      <p>Making friends in Discord sounds easy enough: just find a server, join it, and start chatting. But, if you've ever done this before, you know it isn't nearly this easy.</p>
      <p>There are a lot of problems with discord servers that will be discussed in this blog post, as well as the solutions to most of these issues.</p>
      <h3>What's wrong with making friends in Discord servers?</h3>
      <p>There are a few main problems with trying to make friends in Discord servers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className='fw-bold'>It's hard to find good servers. </span>Many servers are inactive, don't discuss things you like, have strict moderation/power mods, or the countless other possible problems a server could have.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className='fw-bold'>It's hard to find people your age. </span>This is especially true if you're over the age of 18. Most discord servers seem to target younger audiences, so you might feel out of place in a server where everyone is 13-16.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className='fw-bold'>It can be awkward. </span>It's very common to join a Discord server and immediately realize you don't fit in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className='fw-bold'>It's too crowded. </span>With many people talking about different things at the same time, it can be difficult to discuss things you enjoy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className='fw-bold'>It wastes time and demotivates you. </span>After joining a few servers and realizing you either don't fit in, or you just don't like anybody there, you can lose motivation in trying to find friends since it seems futile.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why would I want friends on Discord specifically?</h3>
      <p>Some of the main advantages to Discord over other chat apps are the anonymity, popularity, integration with services such as Spotify and Video Games, and ease of use. Discord is also well know for its unique community - many people feel out of place on subreddits such as "MakeNewFriendsHere", but feel understood on Discord.</p>
      <p>Discord is also used extensively by gamers. If you have a friend on Discord, there's a good chance you both have a PC and can play a PC game together - you can't really say the same thing about apps like Snapchat or Twitter.</p>
      <h3>How do I make friends on Discord Servers?</h3>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, there are many downsides to trying to make friends on Discord servers. It's much easier to use a dedicated friend finding site, such as <Link href={'/'}>DiscoFriends</Link>, in order to meet new Discord friends. However, it's still possible to make Discord friends the "traditional way": by joining servers and talking with people.</p>
      <p>To start, you'll need to find a Discord server to join. <a href='https://disboard.org/'>DISBOARD</a> is a great website for discovering Discord servers - you can enter in a keyword, such as your favorite Video Game or a hobby, and you'll instantly be shown many Discord servers to choose from.</p>
      <p>After finding a Discord server to join, you'll probably need to read and agree to their rules. Every server is different, so make sure you fully understand their rules so you don't break them by accident.</p>
      <p>Finally, you can start talking in one of the channels. It's likely there will be at least one channel you can post to. If people are already discussing something, maybe there's some input or feedback you can bring up. Otherwise, if the last messages were a while ago, you can just start with something as simple as "Hello". You can also ask questions, or go through old messages to bring your input into a conversation had previously.</p>
      <p>As you can probably tell, this is quite complicated and takes a lot of effort and time. It's also not guaranteed to work - some people are just mean and might criticize you for no reason, troll, try to get you banned, etc, leading to you feeling left out and/or ignored.</p>
      <p>To remedy this, we highly recommend using a Discord friend finder site. These sites are unaffiliated with Discord, but they offer you to easily make friends on Discord.</p>
      <h3>How do I make friends on Discord?</h3>
      <p>We recommend using <Link href={'https://www.discofriends.net'}>DiscoFriends</Link> to make friends on Discord. It's easy to get setup and start making friends.</p>
      <p>First, you'll need to go to their <Link href='https://disboard.org/join'>join page</Link> and create an account. Your password should not be the same as your Discord password for security reasons.</p>
      <p>Next, you'll need to go through the interactive tutorial. At the end of it, you'll be able to link your Discord account to DiscoFriends. This step is <span className='fw-bold'>crucial</span> as it's required for people to add you.</p>
      <p>Finally, you'll be taken to the settings page (which you can access by clicking on your username in the top right corner). From here, you can add tags (you'll need at least one to get any matches), a description, your gender, your age, and pronouns. Once you're happy with your profile, you can click on "People" on the navigation bar to start exploring matches.</p>
      <h3>What if I don't get any matches?</h3>
      <p>If you have too few or too specific interests, you won't get any matches. You should add as many tags as you can in order to increase your chance of finding matches. For instance, if I like "Football", I might not get many matches, but if I add "Sports" as a tag, then I'll get more matches.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>In conclusion, it is highly recommended to use a service like <Link href={'https://www.discofriends.net'}>DiscoFriends</Link> to find friends on Discord. Joining Discord servers isn't a complete waste of time and can work, but it's just much easier, safer, and efficient to use DiscoFriends.</p>

    title: 'Making Friends on Discord Servers: Why it can be Difficult',
    created: 'March 27, 2023',
    content: <>
      Discord has become a popular platform for communication and community building, particularly among gamers and online communities. With its emphasis on text-based communication and the ability to create and join servers dedicated to specific topics or interests, Discord has become a hub for social interaction online. However, despite its many benefits, making friends on Discord servers can be challenging. In this article, we'll explore some of the reasons why making friends on Discord servers can be difficult and why a website dedicated to facilitating Discord friend making could help address these challenges.

      <h3>Large Communities</h3>

      One of the primary reasons why making friends on Discord servers can be difficult is the sheer size of many communities. Some Discord servers can have hundreds or even thousands of members, making it challenging to form meaningful connections with individuals. In such large communities, it can be easy to feel like just another face in the crowd, with little opportunity to stand out or make personal connections.

      <h3>Lack of Personal Interaction</h3>

      Another challenge of making friends on Discord servers is the lack of personal interaction that the platform provides. Discord is primarily a text-based platform, which can make it difficult to convey emotions and establish personal connections. While text-based communication has many benefits, it can be challenging to get to know someone on a deeper level when you're limited to text messages. There's also a risk of misinterpreting someone's tone or intent when communicating through text, which can create misunderstandings and strain relationships.

      <h3>Limited Exposure</h3>

      Another challenge of making friends on Discord servers is the limited exposure that users may have to one another. In a large server, it can be difficult to get noticed or form connections, particularly if you're a new member or don't participate in discussions regularly. Many users may simply be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of messages in the server, making it challenging to engage in meaningful conversations or form lasting connections.

      <h3>Diversity of Interests</h3>

      While Discord servers are created around specific topics or interests, members within a server can still have vastly different interests, making it challenging to find like-minded individuals. Even within a server dedicated to a specific game or hobby, members may have different levels of experience, different playstyles, or different preferences, which can make it challenging to form meaningful connections.

      <h3>Time Constraints</h3>

      Finally, time constraints can be a significant challenge when it comes to making friends on Discord servers. Many Discord users are busy with school, work, or other commitments, making it challenging to engage in discussions and form friendships. It can be challenging to find time to chat with others or participate in group activities, particularly if time zones or schedules don't align.

      <h3>How a Website Dedicated to Facilitating Discord Friend Making Could Help</h3>

      While making friends on Discord servers can be challenging, a website dedicated to facilitating Discord friend making could help address many of these challenges. Here are some ways in which such a website could help:

      <h3>Streamline the Process</h3>

      A website specifically designed to facilitate Discord friend making could help connect individuals with similar interests and hobbies, making it easier to establish meaningful connections. By creating a streamlined process for finding and connecting with other Discord users, such a website could help users overcome the barriers to forming friendships that they may encounter on Discord servers.

      <h3>Matching System</h3>

      A matching system could be used to suggest individuals with similar interests, increasing the likelihood of forming strong connections. By using data from user profiles, a matching system could help users find others who share their interests, hobbies, and playstyles. This could help users connect with like-minded individuals more easily, making it easier to form strong friendships.
      <h3>Personalized Approach</h3>

      By allowing users to create profiles and provide information about their interests and hobbies, the website could help users find like-minded individuals more easily. This personalized approach could help users connect with others who share their passions and interests, making it easier to form lasting friendships.

      <h3>Smaller Communities</h3>

      By creating smaller, more intimate communities on the website, users could have a better chance of forming lasting friendships. Unlike large Discord servers, smaller communities could provide users with a sense of belonging and connection, allowing them to get to know others on a more personal level. This could help users overcome the challenges of forming connections in larger, more impersonal communities.

      <h3>Time Management</h3>

      Finally, the website could facilitate scheduling of group activities and events, allowing users to connect and form friendships despite their busy schedules. By providing a platform for organizing events and activities, the website could help users find time to connect with others and engage in meaningful interactions. This could be particularly useful for users who have busy schedules or who live in different time zones.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      Overall, making friends on Discord servers can be a challenge, particularly for users who are new to the platform or who are looking to form deeper connections with others. However, a website dedicated to facilitating Discord friend making could help address many of the challenges associated with making friends on Discord servers. By providing a streamlined process for finding and connecting with other users, a matching system to suggest like-minded individuals, personalized user profiles, smaller communities, and a platform for organizing events and activities, such a website could help users form lasting friendships and connections on Discord.

    title: 'How to effectively communicate with new people on Discord',
    created: 'March 27, 2023',
    content: <>
      <p>Discord is a popular platform for connecting with new people who share your interests. Whether you're looking to join a group chat, host your own server, or just have a one-on-one conversation, effective communication is key to building strong relationships with other users. Here are some tips for communicating effectively with new people on Discord:</p>
      <h2>1. Be clear and concise</h2>
      <p>When you're communicating with new people on Discord, it's important to be clear and concise. Make sure your messages are easy to understand and don't include unnecessary details. Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms that other users may not be familiar with.</p>
      <h2>2. Listen actively</h2>
      <p>Effective communication is a two-way street, and it's important to actively listen to what other users are saying. Pay attention to their messages, ask follow-up questions, and respond thoughtfully. This will show other users that you're engaged and interested in what they have to say.</p>
      <h2>3. Use appropriate language and tone</h2>
      <p>When you're communicating on Discord, it's important to use appropriate language and tone. Avoid using profanity or offensive language, and be respectful of other users' beliefs and opinions. Use a friendly and approachable tone, and avoid sounding dismissive or confrontational.</p>
      <h2>4. Be patient and understanding</h2>
      <p>Communicating with new people on Discord can sometimes be challenging, especially if you have different communication styles or cultural backgrounds. It's important to be patient and understanding, and to give other users the benefit of the doubt. If you don't understand something, ask for clarification rather than assuming the worst.</p>
      <h2>5. Embrace non-verbal communication</h2>
      <p>Discord offers a variety of non-verbal communication tools, such as emojis and reactions, that can help you convey your emotions and reactions without having to type out a lengthy response. Embrace these tools and use them to express yourself and connect with other users.</p>
      <h2>6. Avoid using all caps or excessive punctuation</h2>
      <p>Using all caps or excessive punctuation in your messages can come across as aggressive or confrontational, even if you don't mean it that way. Avoid using these communication styles, and instead focus on using clear and concise language.</p>
      <h2>7. Respect other users' boundaries</h2>
      <p>When you're communicating with new people on Discord, it's important to respect their boundaries. If someone doesn't want to discuss a certain topic, don't push them to do so. If someone doesn't respond to your messages right away, don't take it personally. Give other users the space they need, and they'll appreciate it.</p>
      <h2>8. Use voice chat effectively</h2>
      <p>Voice chat can be a great way to connect with other users on a more personal level. However, it's important to use it effectively. Make sure your microphone is working properly, speak clearly and loudly enough to be heard, and avoid background noise. If you're in a group chat, take turns speaking and don't interrupt others.</p>
      <h2>9. Be mindful of time zones</h2>
      <p>Discord connects users from all over the world, which means you may be communicating with people in different time zones. Be mindful of this and try to schedule conversations and activities at a time that works for everyone involved. If you're unable to do so, be respectful of other users' schedules and don't expect them to be available at all hours of the day and night.</p>
      <h2>10. Use Discord's features effectively</h2>
      <p>Discord offers a variety of features that can help you communicate effectively with new people. For example, you can use direct messages for one-on-one conversations, group chats for discussions with multiple users, and voice and video calls for more personal conversations. Take advantage of these features to connect with other users in the way that works best for you.</p>
      <h2>11. Don't be afraid to ask for help</h2>
      <p>If you're new to Discord or have trouble communicating with other users, don't be afraid to ask for help. Reach out to other users for advice or guidance, or consult Discord's help documentation for more information on how to use the platform effectively.</p>
      <h2>12. Be yourself</h2>
      <p>Finally, when you're communicating with new people on Discord, it's important to be yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not, or pretend to have interests that you don't. Be authentic and honest, and you'll be more likely to connect with other users who share your values and interests.</p>
      <p>Effective communication is key to building strong relationships with new people on Discord. By following these tips, you'll be able to connect with other users in a way that's respectful, engaging, and authentic.</p>

    title: 'Strategies for dealing with toxic behavior on Discord',
    created: 'March 27, 2023',
    content: <>
      <p>Discord is a great platform for connecting with like-minded people, but unfortunately, it's not immune to toxic behavior. Whether it's harassment, hate speech, or other forms of toxic behavior, dealing with these situations can be challenging. In this post, we'll provide some strategies for dealing with toxic behavior on Discord.</p>
      <h2>1. Set clear boundaries</h2>
      <p>One of the most important things you can do to protect yourself from toxic behavior on Discord is to set clear boundaries. If someone is behaving in a way that makes you uncomfortable, let them know. Be firm and direct, and explain how their behavior is impacting you. If they continue to behave in a toxic way, don't be afraid to block or mute them.</p>
      <h2>2. Report toxic behavior to server admins</h2>
      <p>If someone is engaging in toxic behavior on a server you're a member of, report it to the server admins. Most servers have rules against toxic behavior, and admins are responsible for enforcing those rules. Make sure to provide as much information as possible, including screenshots or recordings of the behavior if you have them.</p>
      <h2>3. Use Discord's reporting system</h2>
      <p>If the toxic behavior is happening in direct messages or in a server where you're not a member, use Discord's reporting system. You can report messages, users, and servers directly to Discord, and the company will investigate and take appropriate action if necessary.</p>
      <h2>4. Seek support from other users</h2>
      <p>If you're dealing with toxic behavior on Discord, you don't have to go through it alone. Reach out to other users you trust for support and advice. They may have dealt with similar situations in the past and can offer guidance on how to handle it.</p>
      <h2>5. Take a break if necessary</h2>
      <p>Dealing with toxic behavior can be exhausting, so it's important to take care of yourself. If you need a break from Discord, take one. Log out of the platform for a few hours or even a few days if necessary. Taking time away can help you recharge and come back to Discord with a fresh perspective.</p>
      <h2>6. Focus on positive interactions</h2>
      <p>While it's important to deal with toxic behavior on Discord, it's also important to focus on positive interactions. Seek out users who share your interests and values and engage with them in a positive way. Join servers and communities that promote positive interactions and healthy communication.</p>
      <h2>7. Don't engage with trolls</h2>
      <p>Finally, it's important not to engage with trolls. Trolls thrive on negative attention, and engaging with them only gives them what they want. Instead, focus on positive interactions with other users and ignore or report trolls when you encounter them.</p>
      <p>Dealing with toxic behavior on Discord can be challenging, but by setting clear boundaries, reporting toxic behavior to admins and Discord, seeking support from other users, taking breaks when necessary, focusing on positive interactions, and not engaging with trolls, you can protect yourself and promote healthy communication on the platform.</p>

      <h1>Conversation Starters and Topic Ideas to Keep a Conversation Going on Discord</h1>
      <p>Keeping a conversation going on Discord can be a challenge, especially if you're talking to someone you've never met before. However, with the right conversation starters and topic ideas, you can keep the conversation flowing and build a strong connection with your chat partner.</p>
      <h2>Conversation Starters</h2>
      <p>Here are some conversation starters you can use to kick off a chat on Discord:</p>

        <li>"What's your favorite thing to do in your free time?"</li>
