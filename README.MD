# Discofriends

Discord friend making platform. The site matches people based on interests/tags (similar to Omegle/Chatous) and only shares your Discord tag if you both mutually "Like" eachother (similar to dating sites/apps).

This site is meant to promote long term friendships, rather than short term discussions like Omegle or Chatous, where everything is real-time. 

I feel like this is similar to comparing Discord and Forums - our site is more like a Forum, while Omegle is more like discord.

## History

This was originally created around March 2023. I was planning to put some money into ads and hopefully get something small going, but I ultimatly decided against it as I don't really have the money.
